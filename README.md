# Code to scrape classic-trader.com

Code that scrapes all listings on classic-trader.com.

## Context

As a part of my project [bt-koch/ML-project-classic-trader](https://github.com/bt-koch/ML-project-classic-trader) some code was developed to scrape the advertisements on [classic-trader.com](https://www.classic-trader.com/uk/cars). This code is now extracted from the project and provided in this repository for further use.

In irregular frequencies, I run the scraping process and provide the dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/btkoch/used-cars-data-scraped-from-classictradercom). For further information and metadata please see the description on kaggle.
